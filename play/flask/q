       ppss [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ppss displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use _t_o_p(1) instead.

       This version of ppss accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
       appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally
       identical, due to the many standards and ppss implementations that this
       ppss is compatible with.

       Note that "ppss --aauuxx" is distinct from "ppss aauuxx".  The POSIX and UNIX
       standards require that "ppss --aauuxx" print all processes owned by a user
       named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by
       the --aa option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this ppss may
       interpret the command as "ppss aauuxx" instead and print a warning.  This
       behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.
       It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, ppss selects all processes with the same effective user ID
       (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal
       as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal
       associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in
       [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).
       Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the
       default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the
       executable name.  You can override this with the PPSS__FFOORRMMAATT environment
       variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change the process
       selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned
       by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to
       be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by
       other users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered
       when options are described as being "identical" below, so --MM will be
       considered identical to ZZ and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The
       default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are
       added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be
       shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.

       aa      Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is imposed
              upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-")
              options are used or when the ppss personality setting is BSD-like.
              The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to
              the set of processes selected by other means.  An alternate
              description is that this option causes ppss to list all processes
              with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used
              together with the xx option.

       --AA     Select all processes.  Identical to --ee.

       --aa     Select all processes except both session leaders (see _g_e_t_s_i_d(2))
              and processes not associated with a terminal.

       --dd     Select all processes except session leaders.

       ----ddeesseelleecctt
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified
              conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to --NN.

       --ee     Select all processes.  Identical to --AA.

       gg      Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and may
              be discontinued in a future release.  It is normally implied by
              the aa flag, and is only useful when operating in the sunos4
              personality.

       --NN     Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified
              conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to ----ddeesseelleecctt.

       TT      Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical
              to the tt option without any argument.

       rr      Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       xx      Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is
              imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
              (without "-") options are used or when the ppss personality
              setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this
              manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other
              means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ppss
              to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as ppss), or to list
              all processes when used together with the aa option.

       --CC _c_m_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose
              executable name is given in _c_m_d_l_i_s_t.

       --GG _g_r_p_l_i_s_t
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose real group name or ID is in the _g_r_p_l_i_s_t list.
              The real group ID identifies the group of the user who created
              the process, see _g_e_t_g_i_d(2).

       --gg _g_r_p_l_i_s_t
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by
              session is specified by many standards, but selection by
              effective group is the logical behavior that several other
              operating systems use.  This ppss will select by session when the
              list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID numbers
              will work only when some group names are also specified.  See
              the --ss and ----ggrroouupp options.

       ----GGrroouupp _g_r_p_l_i_s_t
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to --GG.

       ----ggrroouupp _g_r_p_l_i_s_t
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective group name or ID is in _g_r_p_l_i_s_t.  The
              effective group ID describes the group whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see _g_e_t_e_g_i_d(2)).  The --gg
              option is often an alternative to ----ggrroouupp.

       pp _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by process ID.  Identical to --pp and ----ppiidd.

       --pp _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID
              numbers appear in _p_i_d_l_i_s_t.  Identical to pp and ----ppiidd.

       ----ppiidd _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by process ID.  Identical to --pp and pp.

       ----ppppiidd _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a
              parent process ID in _p_i_d_l_i_s_t.  That is, it selects processes
              that are children of those listed in _p_i_d_l_i_s_t.

       qq _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to --qq and

       --qq _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes whose
              process ID numbers appear in _p_i_d_l_i_s_t.  With this option ppss reads
              the necessary info only for the pids listed in the _p_i_d_l_i_s_t and
              doesn't apply additional filtering rules. The order of pids is
              unsorted and preserved. No additional selection options, sorting
              and forest type listings are allowed in this mode.  Identical to
              qq and ----qquuiicckk--ppiidd.

       ----qquuiicckk--ppiidd _p_i_d_l_i_s_t
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to --qq and qq.

       --ss _s_e_s_s_l_i_s_t
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session
              ID specified in _s_e_s_s_l_i_s_t.

       ----ssiidd _s_e_s_s_l_i_s_t
              Select by session ID.  Identical to --ss.

       tt _t_t_y_l_i_s_t
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to --tt and ----ttttyy, but can also
              be used with an empty _t_t_y_l_i_s_t to indicate the terminal
              associated with ppss.  Using the TT option is considered cleaner
              than using tt with an empty _t_t_y_l_i_s_t.

       --tt _t_t_y_l_i_s_t
              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the
              terminals given in _t_t_y_l_i_s_t.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for
              text output) can be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1,
              ttyS1, S1.  A plain "-" may be used to select processes not
              attached to any terminal.

       ----ttttyy _t_t_y_l_i_s_t
              Select by terminal.  Identical to --tt and tt.

       UU _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective user name or ID is in _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t.  The
              effective user ID describes the user whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see _g_e_t_e_u_i_d(2)).  Identical
              to --uu and ----uusseerr.

       --UU _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes
              whose real user name or ID is in the _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t list.  The real
              user ID identifies the user who created the process, see
              _g_e_t_u_i_d(2).

       --uu _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective user name or ID is in _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t.

              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see _g_e_t_e_u_i_d(2)).  Identical
              to UU and ----uusseerr.

       ----UUsseerr _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to --UU.

       ----uusseerr _u_s_e_r_l_i_s_t
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to --uu and
              UU.

OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATT CCOONNTTRROOLL
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by ppss.  The
       output may differ by personality.

       --cc     Show different scheduler information for the --ll option.

       ----ccoonntteexxtt
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       --ff     Do full-format listing. This option can be combined with many
              other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also
              causes the command arguments to be printed.  When used with --LL,
              the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will be
              added.  See the cc option, the format keyword aarrggss, and the
              format keyword ccoommmm.

       --FF     Extra full format.  See the --ff option, which --FF implies.

       ----ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              user-defined format.  Identical to --oo and oo.

       jj      BSD job control format.

       --jj     Jobs format.

       ll      Display BSD long format.

       --ll     Long format.  The --yy option is often useful with this.

       --MM     Add a column of security data.  Identical to ZZ (for SELinux).

       OO _f_o_r_m_a_t
              is preloaded oo (overloaded).  The BSD OO option can act like --OO
              (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined)
              or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to
              determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the
              desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify
              the option in some other way (e.g.  with --OO or ----ssoorrtt).  When
              used as a formatting option, it is identical to --OO, with the BSD
              personality.

       --OO _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Like --oo, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to

              ttiimmee,,ccmmdd, see --oo below.

       oo _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to --oo and ----ffoorrmmaatt.

       --oo _f_o_r_m_a_t
              User-defined format.  _f_o_r_m_a_t is a single argument in the form of
              a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a way to
              specify individual output columns.  The recognized keywords are
              described in the SSTTAANNDDAARRDD FFOORRMMAATT SSPPEECCIIFFIIEERRSS section below.
              Headers may be renamed (ppss --oo ppiidd,,rruusseerr==RReeaallUUsseerr --oo
              ccoommmm==CCoommmmaanndd) as desired.  If all column headers are empty (ppss
              --oo ppiidd== --oo ccoommmm==) then the header line will not be output.
              Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may
              be used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ppss --oo ppiidd,,wwcchhaann==WWIIDDEE--
              WWCCHHAANN--CCOOLLUUMMNN --oo ccoommmm).  Explicit width control (ppss ooppiidd,,
              wwcchhaann::4422,,ccmmdd) is offered too.  The behavior of ppss --oo ppiidd==XX,,
              ccoommmm==YY varies with personality; output may be one column named
              "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple --oo
              options when in doubt.  Use the PPSS__FFOORRMMAATT environment variable
              to specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros
              that may be used to choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.

       ss      Display signal format.

       uu      Display user-oriented format.

       vv      Display virtual memory format.

       XX      Register format.

       --yy     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can
              only be used with --ll.

       ZZ      Add a column of security data.  Identical to --MM (for SELinux).

OOUUTTPPUUTT MMOODDIIFFIIEERRSS
       cc      Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name of
              the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command
              arguments and any modifications to them are thus not shown.
              This option effectively turns the aarrggss format keyword into the
              ccoommmm format keyword; it is useful with the --ff format option and
              with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally
              display the command arguments.  See the --ff option, the format
              keyword aarrggss, and the format keyword ccoommmm.

       ----ccoollss _n
              Set screen width.

       ----ccoolluummnnss _n
              Set screen width.

       ----ccuummuullaattiivvee
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

       ee      Show the environment after the command.

       ff      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       ----ffoorreesstt
              ASCII art process tree.

       hh      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).
              The hh option is problematic.  Standard BSD ppss uses this option
              to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux ppss
              uses this option to totally disable the header.  This version of
              ppss follows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the
              BSD personality has been selected, in which case it prints a
              header on each page of output.  Regardless of the current
              personality, you can use the long options ----hheeaaddeerrss and
              ----nnoo--hheeaaddeerrss to enable printing headers each page or disable
              headers entirely, respectively.

       --HH     Show process hierarchy (forest).

       ----hheeaaddeerrss
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       kk _s_p_e_c Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [++|--]_k_e_y[,[++|--]_k_e_y[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
              SSTTAANNDDAARRDD FFOORRMMAATT SSPPEECCIIFFIIEERRSS section.  The "+" is optional since
              default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic
              order.  Identical to ----ssoorrtt.

                      Examples:
                      ppss jjaaxxkkuuiidd,,--ppppiidd,,++ppiidd

       ----lliinneess _n
              Set screen height.

       nn      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID
              and GID).

       ----nnoo--hheeaaddeerrss
              Print no header line at all.  ----nnoo--hheeaaddiinngg is an alias for this
              option.

       OO _o_r_d_e_r
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD OO option can act like --OO
              (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined)
              or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to
              determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the
              desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify
              the option in some other way (e.g.  with --OO or ----ssoorrtt).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD OO option syntax is
              OO[++|--]_k_1[,[++|--]_k_2[,...]].  It orders the processes listing
              according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence of
              one-letter short keys _k_1,_k_2, ...  described in the OOBBSSOOLLEETTEE SSOORRTT
              KKEEYYSS section below.  The "+" is currently optional, merely
              re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to
              distinguish an OO sort from an OO format.  The "-" reverses
              direction only on the key it precedes.

       ----rroowwss _n
              Set screen height.

       SS      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child
              processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining a
              system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived
              children to do work.

       ----ssoorrtt _s_p_e_c
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [++|--]_k_e_y[,[++|--]_k_e_y[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
              SSTTAANNDDAARRDD FFOORRMMAATT SSPPEECCIIFFIIEERRSS section.  The "+" is optional since
              default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic
              order.  Identical to kk.  For example: ppss jjaaxx ----ssoorrtt==uuiidd,,--ppppiidd,,
              ++ppiidd

       ww      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       --ww     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       ----wwiiddtthh _n

       --mm     Show threads after processes.

       --TT     Show threads, possibly with SPID column.

       ----hheellpp _s_e_c_t_i_o_n
              Print a help message.  The section argument can be one of
              _simple, _list, _output, _threads, _misc or _all.  The argument can be
              shortened to one of the underlined letters as in: s|l|o|t|m|a.

       ----iinnffoo Print debugging info.

       LL      List all format specifiers.

       --VV     Print the procps-ng version.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Print the procps-ng version.

NNOOTTEESS
       This ppss works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This ppss does not
       need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not give this
       ppss any special permissions.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent
       running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal,
       and it does not conform to the standards that ppss otherwise conforms to.
       CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process including
       the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct
       task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is always
       resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+data+stack).

       Processes marked <defunct> are dead processes (so-called "zombies")
       that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.
       These processes will be destroyed by _i_n_i_t(8) if the parent process
       exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display
       column, the username will be truncated. See the -o and -O formatting
       options to customize length.

       Commands options such as ppss --aauuxx are not recommended as it is a
       confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and UNIX
       standards, the above command asks to display all processes with a TTY
       (generally the commands users are running) plus all processes owned by
       a user named "x".  If that user doesn't exist, then ppss will assume you
       really meant "ppss _a_u_x".

PPRROOCCEESSSS FFLLAAGGSS
       The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is
       provided by the ffllaaggss output specifier:

               1    forked but didn't exec
               4    used super-user privileges

PPRROOCCEESSSS SSTTAATTEE CCOODDEESS
       Here are the different values that the ss, ssttaatt and ssttaattee output
       specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of
       a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by
                    its parent

       For BSD formats and when the ssttaatt keyword is used, additional
       characters may be displayed:

               <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads
                    do)
               +    is in the foreground process group

OOBBSSOOLLEETTEE SSOORRTT KKEEYYSS
       These keys are used by the BSD OO option (when it is used for sorting).
       The GNU ----ssoorrtt option doesn't use these keys, but the specifiers
       described below in the SSTTAANNDDAARRDD FFOORRMMAATT SSPPEECCIIFFIIEERRSS section.  Note that
       the values used in sorting are the internal values ppss uses and not the
       "cooked" values used in some of the output format fields (e.g.  sorting
       on tty will sort into device number, not according to the terminal name
       displayed).  Pipe ppss output into the ssoorrtt(1) command if you want to
       sort the cooked values.

       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output
       format (e.g. with option --oo) or to sort the selected processes with the
       GNU-style ----ssoorrtt option.

       For example: ppss --eeoo ppiidd,,uusseerr,,aarrggss ----ssoorrtt uusseerr

       This version of ppss tries to recognize most of the keywords used in
       other implementations of ppss.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces:
       aarrggss, ccmmdd, ccoommmm, ccoommmmaanndd, ffnnaammee, uuccmmdd, uuccoommmm, llssttaarrtt, bbssddssttaarrtt, ssttaarrtt.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

       %%ccppuu        %CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.
                             Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the
                             time the process has been running
                             (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a
                             percentage.  It will not add up to 100% unless
                             you are lucky.  (alias ppccppuu).

                             process marked <defunct> is partly dead, waiting
                             to be fully destroyed by its parent.  Sometimes

       ppss was originally written by Branko Lankester ⟨lankeste@fwi.uva.nl⟩.
       Michael K. Johnson ⟨johnsonm@redhat.com⟩ re-wrote it significantly to
       use the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.  Michael
       Shields ⟨mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu⟩ added the pid-list feature.  Charles
       Blake ⟨cblake@bbn.com⟩ added multi-level sorting, the dirent-style
       library, the device name-to-number mmaped database, the approximate
       binary search directly on System.map, and many code and documentation
       cleanups.  David Mossberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for
       psupdate.  Albert Cahalan ⟨albert@users.sf.net⟩ rewrote ps for full
       Unix98 and BSD support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and
       foreign syntax.
